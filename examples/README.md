## Examples and Tests accompanying JuliaOrbitalElements

1. `run_isochrone.jl`: built to test frequency calculations against a model with analytic frequencies
2. `run_plummer.jl`: built to test numerical frequency calculations in a non-analytic model
3. `run_inversions.jl`: check on mappings between different spaces
4. `run_params.jl`: check that mirror function calls with OrbitsParameters are working
